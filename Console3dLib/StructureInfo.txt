IObject : Position and rotation
IDrawable : Vertices (Can be rendered), Texture? (To do)


TODO:
Collider : Vertices (Can be collided, physics)



Camera render algorithm:
-Loop thru objects
	-Find mvp matrix
	-Loop thru vertices
		-Apply mvp
	-Sort by z
	-Loop thru sorted vertices in order
		-Draw at x,y
